Steps for EO overlap analysis in ArcPro
1. Add boundary layer and EO snapshot to program
1b. Modify boundary layer if needed (e.g., pairwise intersect BLM admin boundary layer with states so have state attributes)
2. Feature class to feature class - save EO snapshot to another folder (can subset EOs by element global ID at this point if have it coded)
3. Calculate geometry attribute - calculate area of EO snapshot
4. PairwiseIntersect of EOs and boundary
5. Calculate Geometry attributes - calcualte area of EOs segments that have boundary attributes associated with them
6. Wrangle data (see "SUBSET AND WRANGLE DATAFRAME FROM EO INTERSECTION" section in jurisdictional-analysis-EOs-code.R)
  a. assign each EO to be within only one boundary type (select the EO segment that is largest, and keep the boundary attribute for that segment)
  b. determine which EOs to include based on their attributes
